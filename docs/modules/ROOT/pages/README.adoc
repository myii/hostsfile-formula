== Available states

=== `hostsfile`

Uses the http://docs.saltstack.com/topics/mine/[Salt Mine] function
`network.ip_addrs` to add minion ids and their regarding ips to the
local hosts file.

At a minimum, you must enable the network.ip_addrs function in pillar or
in `/etc/salt/minion`:

....
mine_functions:
  network.ip_addrs: []
....

The formula works best if the minion id is the fqdn and (if the machines
have more than one interface) the desired interface to use for this is
configured with the mine function:

....
mine_functions:
  network.interfaces: []
  network.ip_addrs:
    - eth1
mine_interval: 2
....

If you are already using network.ip_addrs for something else (perhaps
another state that wants information on a different interface than
hostsfile should use), you can specify a mine alias in pillar to query
instead:

....
hostsfile:
  alias: hostsfile_interface

mine_functions:
  hostsfile_interface:
    mine_function: network.ip_addrs
    iface: eth0
....

By default all minions in mine are added to the hosts file, but that can
be overridden too:

....
hostsfile:
  minions: '*-thisdatacenter-something'
....

By default specified minions in mine are added to the hosts file:

....
hostsfile:
  minions: 'zk[1-5] and kafka[1-5]'
  type: 'compound'
....

And you can add explicit entries for non-mine hosts as well:

....
hostsfile:
  hosts:
    server1: 10.10.10.10
    server2: 10.10.10.11
....

To reduce the hostnames for an IP to those given in pillar you can place
them in `pillar[hostsfile:only]`:

....
hostsfile:
  only:
    10.10.10.10:
        - server1.my.domain
        - server1
    10.10.10.11:
        - server2.my.domain
        - server2
....

To remove an IP from the hostsfile specify an empty list of hostnames:

....
hostsfile:
    only:
        127.0.1.1: []
....

=== `hostsfile.hostname`

Also set and persist the hostname (again - using the minion id). This
has so far been most useful on EC2 instances.

Works on RedHat/CentOS 5.X or RedHat/CentOS 6.X and Amazon OS - should
also work on Ubuntu/Debian.

== Testing

Linux testing is done with `kitchen-salt`.

=== Requirements

* Ruby
* Docker

[source,bash]
----
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
$ bin/kitchen test [platform]
----

Where `[platform]` is the platform name defined in `kitchen.yml`, e.g.
`debian-9-2019-2-py3`.

=== `bin/kitchen converge`

Creates the docker instance and runs the `TEMPLATE` main state, ready
for testing.

=== `bin/kitchen verify`

Runs the `inspec` tests on the actual instance.

=== `bin/kitchen destroy`

Removes the docker instance.

=== `bin/kitchen test`

Runs all of the stages above in one go: i.e. `destroy` + `converge` +
`verify` + `destroy`.

=== `bin/kitchen login`

Gives you SSH access to the instance for manual testing.
